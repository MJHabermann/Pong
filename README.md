# Compiling the Code:
Updating the code will require a new build. If you do not already have unity installed see the instructions below. The Unity version used is 2022.3.42f1 I cannot gurantee that it will work for previous or future versions
1) Download the .zip file or pull the repository from GitHub.
2) Extract the contents into a new file.
3) Open Unity now or download it at https://public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com/hub/prod/UnityHubSetup.exe 
4) Select the Projects in Unity Hub and click the Add button

6) This should open the Unity editor for this game of Pong
7) Go to the folder Assets/Scenes and double click "SampleScene.unity"
8) In the top left corner select file -> Build & Run.
9) Unity will automatically compile everything into the necessary files and create one 
convenient Pong application file that you can click on whenever you would like to play. 
Note Unity creates several other files and folders that must be in the same directory of 
the Pong application for the game to run.
